Significance

A good lubricating oil must have moderate viscosity. If
the viscosity of the lubricating oil is high due to excessive
friction, movement of the machine is restricted. On the otherhand
if the lubricating oil is having low viscosity, the liquid film
cannot be maintained under heavy load or pressure.

2) Viscosity index

The rate at which the viscosity of lubricating oil changes
with rise in temperature is measured by a scale known as
Viscosity Index(V.1).

Viscosity index is defined as “the average decrease in
viscosity of an oil per degree rise in temperature between
100°F and 210°F.

If the increase in temperature makes notable decrease in
the viscosity of the lubricating oil, then the oil has a low viscosi
index. But if the viscosity of the oil is affected slowly on rising
temperature then the V.I of the oil is high.

A good lubricant should have high viscosity index.

3) Oiliness

Oiliness is the tendency of the lubricating oil to stick
the surface of the machine parts under heavy load or pressure.

Significance

A good lubricant should have good oiliness. Lubricating
oils with poor oiliness will be easily squeezed out when machines
